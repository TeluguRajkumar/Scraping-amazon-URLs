# installation
You can simply install the library from PyPi using pip. For more methods check the docs.

pip install amazoncaptcha

##Quick Snippet
An example of the constructor usage. Scroll a bit down to see some tasty class methods. For consistency across different devices, it is highly recommended to use fromlink class method.

from amazoncaptcha import AmazonCaptcha

captcha = AmazonCaptcha('captcha.jpg')
solution = captcha.solve()

# Or: solution = AmazonCaptcha('captcha.jpg').solve()

Usage and Class Methods
Browsing Amazon using selenium and stuck on captcha? The class method below will do all the dirty work of extracting an image from the webpage for you. Practically, it takes a screenshot from your webdriver, crops the captcha and stores it into bytes array which is then used to create an AmazonCaptcha instance. This also means avoiding any local savings. For consistency across different devices, it is highly recommended to use fromlink class method instead of fromdriver.

from amazoncaptcha import AmazonCaptcha
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome() # This is a simplified example
driver.get('https://www.amazon.com/errors/validateCaptcha')

captcha = AmazonCaptcha.fromdriver(driver)
solution = captcha.solve()
If you are not using selenium or the previous method is not just the case for you, it is possible to use a captcha link directly. This class method will request the url, check the content type and store the response content into bytes array to create an instance of AmazonCaptcha.

from amazoncaptcha import AmazonCaptcha

link = 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/captcha/usvmgloq/Captcha_kwrrnqwkph.jpg'

captcha = AmazonCaptcha.fromlink(link)
solution = captcha.solve()
In addition, if you are a machine learning or neural network developer and are looking for some training data, check this repository, which was created to store images and other non-script data for the solver.

Help the Development
If you are willing to help the development, consider setting keep_logs argument of the solve method to True. Here is the example, if you are using fromdriver class method. If set to True, all the links of the unsolved captcha will be stored so that later you can open the issue and send the logs.

from amazoncaptcha import AmazonCaptcha
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome() # This is a simplified example
driver.get('https://www.amazon.com/errors/validateCaptcha')

captcha = AmazonCaptcha.fromdriver(driver)
solution = captcha.solve(keep_logs=True)
